## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am Anthony Guijarro and I'm learning how to work with technology like machine learning and AI, specifically generative natural language processing.

### About me
I'm currently *trying* to learn how to use the tools I have when I have the time, as I'm really busy with life and stuff.\
You can find me messing around in social games like [VRChat][vrc] and [Resonite][neos] *although I'm not social myself*.

### What I like to do
I like messing around with virutal reality technology. Some of my favorite VR games are [Boneworks][slz], [Bonelab][slz], [Beat Saber][bs], and [VRChat][vrchat].\
I play many other games too, you can find me on [Steam].
