## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is Anthony Guijarro and I'm learning how to work with technology like machine learning and AI.

### About me
I'm currently *trying* to learn how to use the tools I have when I have to time, as I'm really busy with life and stuff.\
You can find me messing around in social games like [VRChat][vrc] and Neos VR *although I'm not social myself*.\
If you ever need to contact me you can do so at anthony@gratlie.social ðŸ“«\
Alternatively you may contact me on [Twitter][twt], [Discord][discord], or other accounts listed on my site www.gratlie.social (link currently redirecting to my linktree)\
Currently the tools I have are very limited. I use a [low-end laptop][laptop] running [Arch][arch] with the [Mate][mate] desktop environment. Because I am very limited to the technology I have, I have to rely on cloud computing services like [Shadow][shadow], [Google Cloud][gcloud], and [Microsoft Azure][azure].

### What I like to do
I like messing around with virutal reality technology. Some of my favorite VR games are [Boneworks][slz], [Bonelab][slz], [Beat Saber][bs], and [VRChat][vrchat].\
I play many other games too, you can find me on [Steam].\
Like I've said before, I'm ususally messing around in VRChat with friends. I love the Avali race as you can see below, my VRChat avatar is an Avali *(You can find more pictures over at [Twitter][fvali])*.\
