## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am Anthony Guijarro and I'm learning how to work with technology like machine learning and AI, specifically natural language processing.

### About me
I'm currently *trying* to learn how to use the tools I have when I have the time, as I'm really busy with life and stuff.\
You can find me messing around in social games like [VRChat][vrc] and [Neos VR][neos] *although I'm not social myself*.

### What I like to do
I like messing around with virutal reality technology. Some of my favorite VR games are [Boneworks][slz], [Bonelab][slz], [Beat Saber][bs], and [VRChat][vrchat].\
I play many other games too, you can find me on [Steam].\
Like I've said before, I'm ususally messing around in VRChat with friends. I love the [Avali race][birb] and my VRChat avatar is an Avali. (specifically the [Jerry Avali][jerry] by [Rai Kitamatsu][rai])

### My current hardware:
Model: HP Omen 40L\
CPU: 12th Gen Intel i5\
GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060\
RAM: 16 GB\
Storge: 1TB M.2 SSD, 1TB Sata HDD, 500GB Sata SSD
