## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am Anthony Guijarro and I'm learning how to work with technology like machine learning and AI, specifically generative NLP/language models.

### About me
I'm currently *trying* to learn how to use the tools I have when I have the time, as I'm really busy with life and stuff.\
You can find me messing around in social games like [VRChat][vrc] *although I'm not social myself*.\
I love cats üêæ

### What I like to do
I like messing around with virutal reality technology. Some of my favorite VR games are [Boneworks][slz], [Bonelab][slz], [Beat Saber][bs], and [VRChat].\
I play many other games too, you can find me on [Steam] and [Discord].\
Modded Minecraft is also pretty fun. I personally prefer mods that add onto the game instead of changing it like extra mobs and dimentions.
